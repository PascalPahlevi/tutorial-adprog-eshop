## Reflection 1
Following the principles of coding practices, the first principle I thoroughly applied are meaningful names. In order to distinguish the different classes in the code, I made sure to use words such as "update", "edit". and "delete" instead simple letters like a,b,c. Though both ways of naming are not wrong, using more distinctive names would enhance code readability especially for bigger projects. Aside from that, the code is also organized into multiple functions, differentiating each one with their own respective roles which allows a clearer code. 

In the case of secure coding practices, input validation was applied for the "productId" parameter in order to prevent common security issues. Aside from that, the productId for each generated product is created using UUID's which randomly generates hence reducing predictability. 

However, when it comes to my code, I do believe that some improvements may still be done to improve it overall. For one, since I generally focused on the function of the code, I neglected the idead to implement error handling. Due to this, in the event that an unexpected error occurs, it may be harder to examine the issues, leading to higher time consumption when fixing them.
